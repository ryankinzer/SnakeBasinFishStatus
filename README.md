# SnakeBasinFishStatus
Snake Basin Steelhead and Chinook population status assessment indicators and metrics.

The goal of this work is to provide data for the upcoming status assessment. This should include estimates of total escapement to various TRT populations in the Snake River Basin, as well as estimates of female escapement (for productivity estimates) and estimates of escapement by brood year.
