Initial configuration of the site included 3-20ft, Biomark Lite antennas, each spanning the wetted width of the creek. Antenna 1 is upstream, 2 middle, and 3 is the downstream antenna. Antennas 2 and 3 were damaged February 2016 and were replaced in February 2017 with 24 x 8 ft quadrilaterlas constructed with 1 inch PEX. Ten inch posts were used on the bottom of the creek to create a backbone for the antennas.  The posts are secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors.  The sides of the antennas are secured using anchors on an exposed bank, clamps on trees and one t-post for antenna 3.  Antennas 2 and 3 have a complete field of detection with 24 inches of read range off the coil.  Each antenna is connected to a submersible IS1001 antenna control node which are anchored to the bank.

In October of 2018, the site was relocated 200 below Lambert bridge, 5 miles east of Cle Elum Washington (47.174326, -120.836400).  The IS1001 MTS is powered by a 200 Ah 24V battery bank charged with a 24V, 8A Interacter charger which is connected to grid power.  There are two CAN bus trunk lines ~60 long that are connected to the upper and lower rows of ACNs.  The submersible enclosures for the IS1001s were constructed by Yakama Nation Fisheries and consist of schedule 40 PVC with various fittings.  The submersibles were pressure tested to ensure a water tight enclosure.  They are located 8 below each antenna and are daisy chained together.  Hydrovolt plugs are located between each submersible for the CAN bus cabling  and from submersible to antenna allowing each component to detatch under extreme flow conditions.  The CAN bus cabling is routed in a straight line 8 below each row of antennas and is secured to 3/8 stainless steel cable using zip ties.  The stainless steel cable is secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors, ~10 apart.  Both rows of antennas consist of 3, 25X30 HDPE flat plates constructed by Yakama Nation spanning the entire channel under most flow conditions.  The antennas are secured to the substrate using MR-4 anchors and a combination of NRS and ratchet straps.
